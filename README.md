# social-network-api

## What this app does
This API was built for a social network web application to allow users to share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. This API enables websites to handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Technologies used
This app uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database (a type of NoSQL database), and the Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) library. This app also uses the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps for when thoughts are posted on the social network application.
